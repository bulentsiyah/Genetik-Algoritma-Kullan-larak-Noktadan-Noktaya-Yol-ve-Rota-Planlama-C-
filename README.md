# Using Genetic Algorithm the road to Point-to-Point and Route Planning (C#)

In this study, it is aimed to find the route and path between points on a sketch by genetic algorithm. Since the genetic algorithm is a random search method, it works on a solution set instead of looking for a single solution. The optimum solution is reached on some of the possible solutions. Thus, the results in the study are not always the best. The reason for using the genetic algorithm in the study is that the genetic algorithm does not need any information about the nature of the problem. Basically, the study, which is similar to the traveler salesman problem, is intended to be a solution for problems similar to the traveler seller problem.
